1. In Player class, setting default argument value chunks = {} caused ALL 
   instances of the Player class to share the chunks dict(). This was fixed by 
   setting it to None and performing an explicit check for None in the 
   constructor.

2. Not really a "bug", but we kept on getting truncated data error while
   deserializing our gameboard instance in client. This was fixed by writing 
   new functions send_data and recv_data that first sent the size of the data 
   that was going to be sent, followed by the actual data itself so the buffer 
   size is dynamic at the time of receiving data!
